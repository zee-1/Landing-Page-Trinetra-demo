This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a landing page project for Trinetra AI Solutions - a premium AI consultancy that bridges ancient Vedic wisdom with modern AI technology. The project is currently in planning phase with comprehensive documentation but no code implementation yet.

## Architecture & Design

**Core Concept:** "Digital Vedas" - Where Process Meets AI

**Technology Stack (Planned):**
- Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- Animation: Framer Motion, Three.js for 3D elements
- Data Management: JSON-based content management
- Build System: Vite
- Deployment: Vercel/Netlify with CDN

**Design Philosophy:**
- Visual-first approach (80-95% visual, 5-20% text across sections)
- Sacred geometry patterns (Sri Yantra, Fibonacci spirals)
- Mathematical equations as design elements
- Constellation-like network visualizations
- Particle systems representing data flow

## Data Structure

The project uses JSON-based content management with the following schema:
- `hero`: Tagline, subtitle, and visual elements configuration
- `expertise`: Founder profiles and credentials
- `solutions`: Service objects with icons and benefits
- `product`: Hospitality AI features for customers and providers
- `contact`: Contact information and calendar integration

## Key Components (Planned)

1. **Hero Section**: Animated 3D mandala morphing into neural network
2. **Philosophy Section**: Interactive timeline from Vedic math to modern AI
3. **Solutions Showcase**: Hexagonal grid with animated service icons
4. **Product Spotlight**: Split-screen interactive hospitality AI demo
5. **Technology Visualization**: 3D rotating brain/neural network hybrid
6. **Contact Portal**: Minimalist form with glassmorphism effects

## Performance Requirements

- Initial Load: < 2 seconds (FCP)
- Interactive: < 3.5 seconds (TTI)
- Lighthouse Score: > 90 for all metrics
- Animation FPS: Consistent 60fps
- Bundle Size: < 500KB gzipped

## Responsive Design

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 769px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px - 1920px
- Large: 1921px+

**Mobile Adaptations:**
- 3D elements simplified to 2D animations
- Hexagonal grid becomes vertical cards
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Reduced particle counts for performance

## Accessibility Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader optimized with ARIA labels
- Reduced motion option for animations
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation**: React setup, JSON data structure, base components
2. **Core Sections**: Hero, solutions grid, contact form, responsive layout
3. **Advanced Visuals**: 3D elements, complex animations, interactive demos
4. **Polish & Launch**: Testing, accessibility, performance, deployment

- Main content structure: `docs/User-Content.md`
- Detailed specifications: `docs/PRD.md`

## Notes

- This is currently a planning/documentation phase project
- No package.json, build scripts, or code files exist yet
- Implementation will begin with React TypeScript setup
- Focus on visual storytelling over text-heavy content
